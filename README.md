# QGNN-CoPE
# Quantum-Inspired GNN for Commodity-Equity Contagion and Portfolio Optimization

## Project Overview

This project presents a novel deep learning framework for modeling and predicting financial contagion between commodity and equity markets. The core of this research is the development of a **Quantum-Inspired Graph Neural Network (QW-GNN)**, which leverages principles from Continuous-Time Quantum Walks to better capture the complex, dynamic relationships between financial assets.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end quantitative finance workflow:
1.  **Data Engineering:** Processing and cleaning years of high-frequency, multi-source financial data.
2.  **Advanced Modeling:** Designing and implementing a novel GNN architecture.
3.  **Rigorous Validation:** Benchmarking the QW-GNN against state-of-the-art models (GAT) and performing ablation studies to validate its unique components.
4.  **Causal Inference:** Moving beyond simple correlation to model the system using directed graphs of influence based on Granger Causality.
5.  **Practical Application:** Using the model's superior risk forecasts to drive a dynamic portfolio optimization strategy, demonstrating significant alpha generation over a static benchmark.

The entire project was conducted in a Paperspace Gradient environment, utilizing an NVIDIA A6000 GPU to handle the computationally intensive model training and data processing tasks.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
The project utilizes a high-frequency dataset of minute-bar prices (2010-2018) for 8 key assets representing global equities and commodities: **SPX500, NAS100, JP225, DAX30, WTI Oil, Gold, Natural Gas, and Corn**.

The raw data was highly inconsistent, requiring a robust data loading pipeline to handle multiple file formats, schemas, and delimiters. The cleaned minute-bar data was then resampled to an hourly frequency to compute two primary features:
- **Realized Volatility:** The square root of the sum of squared log returns, serving as our main node feature and risk indicator.
- **Log Returns:** Used to construct the relationships between assets.

### 2. Dynamic Graph Construction
To capture the time-varying nature of financial contagion, the system was modeled as a dynamic graph. Two types of graphs were constructed:
1.  **Correlation Graph:** An initial baseline where edge weights are the 20-day rolling Pearson correlations between asset returns.
2.  **Granger Causality Graph:** A more sophisticated **directed graph** where an edge `A -> B` exists if the past returns of asset A help predict the future returns of asset B. Edge weights are defined as `1 - p_value` of the Granger Causality test, creating a stronger connection for more significant causal links.

### 3. The Quantum-Inspired GNN (QW-GNN)
The core innovation is a custom GNN architecture where the message-passing mechanism is inspired by Continuous-Time Quantum Walks (CTQWs).
- **Propagator:** Instead of using the adjacency matrix `A` directly, the layer uses the CTQW propagator `U(t) = exp(-i * A * t)`, where `exp` is the matrix exponential.
- **Complex-Valued Network:** The entire network operates on complex numbers (`torch.complex32`) to accommodate the imaginary unit `i`, allowing the model to learn both magnitude and phase information.
- **Final Architecture:** The model uses two QW-GNN layers with a custom CReLU activation function, followed by a readout MLP with a `Softplus` activation to ensure non-negative volatility predictions.

### 4. Portfolio Optimization Framework
To demonstrate economic value, the QW-GNN was adapted to predict the full **forward-looking covariance matrix** of asset returns. At each step in the test period, these predictions were fed into a **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimizer** to find the portfolio weights that maximize the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio).

## Results and Key Findings

### Finding 1: QW-GNN Outperforms Standard GNNs
The QW-GNN was benchmarked against a state-of-the-art Graph Attention Network (GAT). The GAT model collapsed, failing to learn any meaningful patterns and defaulting to predicting the mean. In contrast, the QW-GNN successfully learned the underlying dynamics.

### Finding 2: Granger Causality Improves Forecast Quality
The model's performance was significantly enhanced when using the more meaningful Granger Causality graph. While the MAE metric was comparable, the visual quality and responsiveness of the forecast improved dramatically, more closely tracking volatility spikes.

### Finding 3: The "Quantum" Component is Essential (Ablation Study)
An ablation study was conducted to prove the value of the quantum walk propagator. A `ClassicalGNN` (using a simple `A @ X` convolution) was tested. The results were definitive.

### Finding 4: The Model Generates Significant Economic Alpha
The final backtest demonstrates the tangible value of the QW-GNN's superior risk forecasts. The GNN-driven portfolio dramatically outperformed a standard 1/N benchmark.

## Conclusion
This project successfully designed, implemented, and rigorously validated a novel Quantum-Inspired Graph Neural Network for modeling financial contagion. The QW-GNN demonstrated superior performance over standard GNN benchmarks and its core components were validated through an ablation study. Most importantly, when applied to a dynamic portfolio optimization task, the model's forward-looking risk forecasts were shown to generate significant alpha, achieving an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 1.04. This work provides strong evidence that paradigms from quantum physics, when applied to graph deep learning, can provide a powerful new toolkit for tackling complex problems in quantitative finance.
